# Simple-Calculator  
This is my simple calculator code.  
This is a console based program which will allow the user to   
input an equation with 2 variables and perform basic operation on it.  
Ex:-   
console input:  
24+3  
console output:  
24 + 3 = 27  
and further subtraction, multiplication and division can be performed on it.
